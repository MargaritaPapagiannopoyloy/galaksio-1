Galaksio v0.3.1 September 2017

## Version Log

** VERSION 0.3.1 September 2017 **
  - Visual improvements.

** VERSION 0.3 September 2017 **
  - Adding some error control logic and forcing the reload of the page after sign-out (will cancel automatically all the
    pending requests) to avoid error messages after signing out (Issue #2).
  - Now the panel showing the current invocation state shows also the state for each step in the workflow. Besides
    the results for the workflow execution are always shown even if the workflow failed.
    Additionally, the user can get more details for each step in the workflow and see the used parameters and other useful
    information (Issue #13 and #28).
  - Added a more developed method for form validation. Now erroneous fields are indicated at the top of the form and at
    the right of each invalid input with a red exclamation symbol. Besides, the application will autofocus the first
    invalid field (Issue #10 and #14).
  - Added support for "section" data types (Issue #11)
  - Upgraded the version of "AngularJS dialogs" library to support the Report button handler (Issue #12).
  - Added settings to configure a SMTP server in Galaksio and send the error report via email to the developers account.
    Alternatively, if not SMTP settings are provided, the report is forwarded to a main Galaksio server which will send
    the report by email (Issue #12).
  - Fixed some visual issues (Issue #17).
  - Display step name (if any) in data and data collection inputs (Issue #16).
  - Added +/- zoom button in workflow diagram, now mouse wheel is used only for scrolling (Issue #18).
  - Added affix support to history list, now the left panel scrolls down following the window (Issue #20).
  - Replaced yes/no checkboxes by 2 state button (Issue #22).
  - Replaced radio buttons by a drop-down menu (Issue #23).
  - Replaced multi-select fields by list of checkboxes (Issue #24).
  - Fixed to aggressive warning during input data (Issue #25)
  - Fixed issues with workflow execution state (erroneous "Finished" state after sending) (Issue #26 and #27)
  - Forced to recreate the forms when going back to step 2 during Workflow execution (Issue #31 and #29)
  - Added a "Read more" button in workflow description (workflow card) when description is too long (Issue #30).
  - Added tools for filtering the list of invocations. Besides, we have improved the performance when retrieving the
    list of invocations and their state (reduce the number of requests, avoid repeating requests,...).
