## What is a Workflow in Galaxy
*Extracted from Galaxy project documentation*
* A workflow is a series of tools and dataset actions that run in sequence as a batch operation.
* Workflows can be created from scratch using the workflow editor.
* Workflows can be annotated, viewed, shared, published, and imported - just like other Galaxy objects.
* Any workflow that you have permissions to import, you can modify with the workflow editor.
* Workflow can be reused over and over, not only reducing tedious work, but enhancing reproducibility by applying the same exact methods to all of your data.
