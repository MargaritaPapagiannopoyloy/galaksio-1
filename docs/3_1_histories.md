# Browsing data in Galaksio
## Histories in Galaksio
As we've already seen, in Galaxy, when data is uploaded from your computer or an analysis is done, each output file generates a dataset that is stored by Galaxy in Histories.

Galaksio provides multiple tools for easily manipulating your Histories and Datasets that are accessible by clicking at the *Histories* option in the left menu bar. The *Histories* section is divided in two panels (Figure 1). The first panel displays all the histories that are saved in your Galaxy account. The history panel allows switching between them, which can be useful to organize different analyses. The second panel displays the datasets and the collections that were added to a selected history. You can browse the contents of a history by clicking on the corresponding row in the Histories table. By default, the panel displays the contents of the current history.

## Managing datasets
Datasets can be uploaded, downloaded or deleted from your history. Galaksio provides tools for uploading small-medium files (less than 2GB) from your disk. Use the tool "Upload new files" to open the dialog for file uploading. For bigger files you might want to use other options, such as FTP upload.

## Managing dataset collections
When you have just a few samples - clicking through them is easy. But once you've got hundreds - it becomes very annoying. Galaxy includes Dataset collections that allow you to combine numerous datasets in a single entity that can be easily manipulated.

Figures 3-5 display the creation of a "Dataset list" collection. In order to create a new dataset collection, first we need to choose the type and a name for the new collection (Figure 3). In the next step, we choose the datasets that we want to include in our new collection (Figure 4). Once we've selected all the datasets, we can confirm the creation of the new collection (Figure 5). The new collection will be displayed in the current history.
